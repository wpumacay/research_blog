</ol>

<h2 id="7-an-overview-of-the-improvements-to-vanilla-dqn">7. An overview of the improvements to vanilla DQN</h2>

<p>After completing the base DQN implementation I decided to try implementing the
improvements mentioned in the lectures, namely: Double DQN, Prioritized Experience
Replay, and Dueling DQN. So far, we have implemented the first two, and in this section
we will discuss them both.</p>

<h3 id="71-double-dqn">7.1 Double DQN</h3>

<p>This improvement tries to deal with the overestimation of the action-values that are
used for the TD-targets. Recall the targets calculation from vanilla DQN:</p>

<p><span  class="math">\[
TD_{targets} = r + \gamma \max_{a'}Q(s',a';\theta^{-})
\]</span></p>

<p>By definition, we can rewrite this equation as follows :</p>

<p><span  class="math">\[
TD_{targets} = r + \gamma Q(s',\argmax_{a'}Q(s',a';\theta^{-});\theta^{-})
\]</span></p>

<p>These two eqs. are equivalent because we are evaluating the Q-value for the greedy action
(second eq.), which is the same as taking the max. Q-value over all actions (first eq.).
Let's make the components of the equation even clearer, by identifying each term:</p>

<p><span  class="math">\[
TD_{targets} = r + \gamma \underbrace{Q(s',\overbrace{\argmax_{a'}Q(s',a';\theta^{-})}^{\text{Action chosen to be the best}};\theta^{-})}_{q_{best}:\text{Q-value for the "best" action}}
\]</span></p>

<p>The issue with this evaluation comes from evaluating q-values for actions chosen
to be the best in specific steps during training, which might not be the best. Also
even if these actions are actually the best actions, we still could overestimate
its value because the network that evaluates it might just not be fully trained properly
(which happens in early stages of training).</p>

<p>To avoid this issue of overestimation the authors of [11] introduced the idea of
Double DQN, which builds on top of the idea of Double Q-learning introduced by
Van Hasselt [10]. The idea consists of using two function approximators to compute
the TD-targets, instead of just one, as shown in the following equation.</p>

<p><span  class="math">\[
TD_{targets} = r + \gamma \underbrace{Q(s',\overbrace{\argmax_{a'}Q(s',a';\theta)}^{\text{Chosen using $Q_{\theta}$}};\theta^{-})}_{\text{Evaluated using $Q_{\theta^{-}}$}}
\]</span></p>

<p>Some visualizations from [11] are shown below, which show the effect of overestimation
when using function approximation (in a simple test problem) and how Double Q-learning
can potentially fix these issues. The test problem consists on a continuous state-space
with just 1 dimension (shown along x-axis) and a discrete action space with 10 actions.
The problem is set up such that all actions have the same true value equal to the
optimal value ( \( Q^{\star}(s,a) = V^{\star}(s), \forall a \in \mathbb{A} \) ).
The estimates are built using polinomials of 6th degree fitted to samples of the
optimal Q-value function at various points of the state space. Rows represent cases
with different \( Q^{\star} \), whereas columns represent the study of overestimation.</p>

  </figure>



<p>As suggested in [11], the easiest addition we can make to our code is to use both
action-value and target action-value networks for Double DQN, using the action-value
network for computing the greedy action, and the target network to evalue the
q-value for this action. A snippet of these changes (from the <a href="https://github.com/wpumacay/DeeprlND-projects/blob/3bced7f6c4d9fea2439df2ad6c9d8ff7986cb5b8/project1-navigation/navigation/dqn/core/agent.py#L245">agent.py</a>
file) that implements the required steps is shown below:</p>

<pre><code class="language-python">if self._useDoubleDqn :
    # targets are computed in the following way
    #
    # 
    # q-target = r + gamma * Q( s', argmax( Q(s',a';theta) ); theta )
    #                        ^         a'               actor     target
    #                        |
    #                        |              ^
    #     qvalue from target model          |
    #                                       |
    #                             greedy action from actor model

    # compute qvalues from both actorModel and targetModel
    _qvals_actorModel_s   = self._qmodel_actor.eval( _nextStates )
    _qvals_targetModel_s  = self._qmodel_target.eval( _nextStates )

    # greedy actions
    _argmaxActions = np.argmax( _qvals_actorModel_s, 1 ).reshape( -1, 1 )

    # compute qtargets from the qvals of target network, ...
    # using greedy actions from the actor network
    _qtargets = _rewards + ( 1 - _dones ) * self._gamma * \
                np.squeeze( np.take_along_axis( _qvals_targetModel_s, _argmaxActions, axis = 1 ) )
else :
    # targets are just computing the target network
    _qtargets = _rewards + ( 1 - _dones ) * self._gamma * \
                np.max( self._qmodel_target.eval( _nextStates ), 1 )
</code></pre>

<h3 id="72-prioritized-experience-replay">7.2 Prioritized Experience Replay</h3>

<p>So far we have been sampling uniformly from the replay buffer, regardless of how
important the experience tuples might be for training, which seems not intuitive
as during our experiences with the world there might be some experiences that could
help us learn the most (kind of life lessons). Prioritized Experience Replay (PER),
introduced in [12], is a heuristic that tries to solve this problem by adding some
priority to certain experience tuples in the replay buffer, and then sample them
according to these priorities.</p>

<p>So, instead of sampling uniformly from the replay buffer:</p>

<p><span  class="math">\[
\left \{ ( s_{j}, a_{j}, r_{j+1}, a_{j+1} ) \right \} \sim D_{vanilla}
\]</span></p>

<p>PER samples in a prioritized way from the replay buffer:</p>

<p><span  class="math">\[
\left \{ ( s_{j}, a_{j}, r_{j+1}, a_{j+1}, w_{j} ) \right \} \sim D_{prioritized}
\]</span></p>

<p>There are various details that have to be considered in order to implement PER,
namely:</p>

<ul>
<li>What measure should we use for the priorities?</li>
<li>Why is there a \( w_{j} \) in the returned samples?</li>
<li>How do we add priorities to the replay buffer, and how do we sample?</li>
</ul>

<p>These details are related to (respectively):</p>

<ul>
<li>Computing priorities from Bellman Errors.</li>
<li>Importance Sampling (we have to fix a distribution mismatch).</li>
<li>An efficient implementation for the prioritized buffer.</li>
</ul>

<!--We will discuss these details in the following sections. Also, there are two extra-->

<!--files that we will be refering to:-->

<!---->

<!--* [prioritybuffer.py](https://github.com/wpumacay/DeeprlND-projects/blob/master/project1-navigation/navigation/dqn/utils/prioritybuffer.py),-->

<!--  which contains the implementation of the prioritized replay buffer we will use for PER.-->

<!--* [segmentree.py](https://github.com/wpumacay/DeeprlND-projects/blob/master/project1-navigation/navigation/dqn/utils/segmentree.py),-->

<!--  which contains the data structures used to efficiently sample using priorities and-->

<!--  store experience tuples.-->

<h3 id="computing-priorities">Computing priorities</h3>

<p>The measure we will use to compute priorities are the Bellman Errors (or TD-Errors),
whose expression is shown below (without the double dqn improvement):</p>

<p><span  class="math">\[
\delta = r + \gamma \max_{a'} Q(s',a';\theta^{-}) - Q(s,a;\theta)
\]</span></p>

<p>This makes sense as a measurement because if the errors are big, then that is a measure
of how off are our estimates. For the case that we had an oracle (true q-values for the
targets), these errors are the actual values we have to be close to. In our case, we
are using estimates with the target network, but these still give some similar information.
Moreover, the targets at almost terminal states (1-step before terminal) reduce to the
actual returns from those states, so if they are in the replay buffer, and the error
is big for them, we should use them with more priority. So, we have the following
measure for our priorities, using the <strong>absolute value of the Bellman Error</strong>:</p>

<p><span  class="math">\[
p_{t} = \vert \delta_{t} \vert
\]</span></p>

<p>Thus, we can sample using this priorities by defining the following probability
for each sample:</p>

<p><span  class="math">\[
P(j) = \frac{p_{j}}{\sum_{k}p_{k}}
\]</span></p>

<p>A slight issue comes when the TD-error is very small (or even zero). This makes the
sampling process avoid picking experiences that have small TD-error (or even not picking
them at all if zero). So, to avoid this issue a small positive amount of priority is added
to ensure the priorities don't become zero, as shown in the equation below.</p>

<p><span  class="math">\[
p_{t} = \vert \delta_{t} \vert + e
\]</span></p>

<p>Finally, to control how much we let the priority affect the sample probabilities
a hyperparameter \( \alpha \) is introduced as follows:</p>

<p><span  class="math">\[
P(j) = \frac{p_{j}^{\alpha}}{\sum_{k}p_{k}^{\alpha}}
\]</span></p>

<h3 id="sampling-from-a-different-distribution">Sampling from a different distribution</h3>

<p>Because we are sampling using the priorities, we are effectively sampling from
another distribution (other than the uniform distribution). Notice that the priorities
will make some samples come more frequently than others. Also, try to visualize
how the distribution changes from uniform to a distribution with peaks that depend
on the priorities.</p>

<p>Recall our objective, which was defined as an expectation:</p>

<p><span  class="math">\[
L(\theta) = \mathbb{E}_{(s,a,r,s') \sim D} \left \{ ( r + \gamma \max_{a'} Q_{\theta^{-}}(s',a') - Q_{\theta}(s,a) )^{2} \right \}
\]</span></p>

<p>To effectively remove the mismatch in distributions we have to make use of
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S3LAOZxGcnk&amp;list=PLD0F06AA0D2E8FFBA&amp;index=131"><strong>Importance Sampling</strong></a>
as follows:</p>

<p><span  class="math">\[
L(\theta) = \mathbb{E}_{(s,a,r,s') \sim D_{prioritized} } \left \{ \frac{p(D)}{p(D_{prioritized})} ( r + \gamma \max_{a'} Q_{\theta^{-}}(s',a') - Q_{\theta}(s,a) )^{2} \right \}
\]</span></p>

<p>The ratio \( w = \frac{p(D)}{p(D_{prioritized})} \) is the weight that has to be applied
to correct for this mismatch, and it's computed from the probability that a sample is drawn
from the buffer <strong>uniformly</strong> \( p(D) \), and the probability that a sample is drawn
from the buffer <strong>using priorities</strong> \( p(D_{prioritized}) \). These weights can then be used
to compute a modified loss function. As we will see in the implementation section later,
instead of directly using the Mean Square Error loss from our DL package, we will make a modified
loss to take into account importance sampling weights.</p>

<h3 id="data-structure-for-sampling-and-storing-with-priorities">Data structure for sampling and storing with priorities</h3>

<p>For the replay buffer from vanilla DQN we used a simple <strong>deque</strong> (or we could have
also use a big numpy array an keep track of a buffer indexing variable). To support sampling using
priorities the authors of [12] give two possible implementations (see Appendix B.2.1
from [12]):</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Rank-based prioritization</strong>: This implementation makes use of a priority queue
built using a binary heap.</li>
<li><strong>Proportional prioritization</strong>: This implementation uses a &quot;sum-tree&quot; data structure.</li>
</ul>

<p>We will use the second implementation, and explain how the datastructure works to
enable efficient storing and sampling using priorities. This makes use of a <strong>Sum Tree</strong>,
which is a specific case of a <a href="https://www.hackerearth.com/practice/data-structures/advanced-data-structures/segment-trees/tutorial/"><strong>Segment Tree</strong></a>
data structure, which consists of (quoting the previous linked resource):</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;A Segment Tree is basically a binary tree used for storing
intervals or segments. Each node in the segment Tree represents
an interval&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>An example of a Segment Tree is shown below:</p>


  <figure class="center" >
    <img src="https://wpumacay.github.io/research_blog/imgs/img_per_segmentree.png"  alt="fig-per-segmentree"   style="border-radius: 8px;"  />
    
      <figcaption class="center" >Figure 29. An example of a Segment Tree, where each node in the binary tree represents an interval/segment over the leaves.Image taken from [13]</figcaption>
    
  </figure>



<p>As you can see from the figure, each node in the tree represents an interval. Because
it's a binary tree, we can efficiently query and update specific interval in O(log n),
and worst case O(n) if the tree is unbalanced.</p>

<p>We can make use of this property of querying intervals to make efficient samples using
priorities, where each interval at the leaves would consist of the priorities each leave
has. The Segment Tree used for this case is a <strong>Sum Tree</strong>, which implements a Segment Tree
with a sum operator that stores in each node the sum of its children. An example of such
sum tree is shown below :</p>


  <figure class="center" >
    <img src="https://wpumacay.github.io/research_blog/imgs/img_per_sumtree_priorities.png"  alt="fig-per-sumtree-priorities"   style="border-radius: 8px;"  />
    
      <figcaption class="center" >Figure 30. An example of a Sum Tree, where each node is the sum of its children.</figcaption>
    
  </figure>



<p>From the figure we could also see that in order to sample using the priorities in the
leaves of the tree we essentially divide the whole segment composed of the unions of the
priorities as segments into a number of bins required by the number of samples that
we want to take (3 in that case). This effectivetly let's us sample using the priorities
because each priority becomes a segment, and the chance of a random sample in a bin
to land in that segment is proportional to the length of the segment.</p>

<p>The Sum Tree let's us query in which interval a given random number will land, by
searching through the nodes of the tree until the required leave is found (corresponding
to the interval in which the sample will land in the union of segments view).</p>

<p>Finally, updates can also be made to the tree when new priorities are available,
i.e. when new bellman errors are computed for a minibatch. Notice that we are updating
priorities over the minibatch only, and not the whole elements in the prioritized
replay buffer, which is discussed in section 3.3 on Stochastic Prioritization in [12].</p>

<h3 id="implementation">Implementation</h3>

<p>The full implementation of PER is distributed over four files:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://github.com/wpumacay/DeeprlND-projects/blob/master/project1-navigation/navigation/dqn/utils/segmentree.py">segmentree.py</a>,
which implements the Segment Tree, Sum Tree, and Min Tree (used for keeping track
of the min priority) data structures. This implementation was based on OpenAI
baselines [14], and in <a href="https://github.com/MorvanZhou/Reinforcement-learning-with-tensorflow/blob/master/contents/5.2_Prioritized_Replay_DQN/RL_brain.py">this</a>
and <a href="https://github.com/jaromiru/AI-blog/blob/master/SumTree.py">this</a> two implementations.
We kept a MinTree as in the OpenAI baselines implementation to be consistent with
their implementation. However, I think we could have just kept a variable updated with the min
at each update of the priorities as well.</p></li>

<li><p><a href="https://github.com/wpumacay/DeeprlND-projects/blob/master/project1-navigation/navigation/dqn/utils/prioritybuffer.py">prioritybuffer.py</a>,
which implements the prioritized replay buffer. It was also based on the three resources
mentioned above.</p></li>

<li><p><a href="https://github.com/wpumacay/DeeprlND-projects/blob/master/project1-navigation/navigation/dqn/core/agent.py">agent.py</a>,
which has a slight modification for the learning method to take into account importance
sampling.</p></li>

<li><p><a href="https://github.com/wpumacay/DeeprlND-projects/blob/master/project1-navigation/navigation/model_pytorch.py">model_pytorch.py</a>,
which implements the required modifications to the loss function when using PER.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>We will focus mainly in the implementation of the priority buffer, the changes made
to the agent base code and the changes made to the model. I'd suggest the reader
to refer to the resources about the segmentree and the implementation (this one
and the others as well) to fully understand the sumtree and mintree data structures.
Some tests of the segmentTree, sumTree and minTree can be found in the <a href="https://github.com/wpumacay/DeeprlND-projects/blob/master/project1-navigation/tests.ipynb">tests.ipynb</a>
notebook at the root of the provided package.</p>

<p>The key methods in the priority buffer are the <a href="https://github.com/wpumacay/DeeprlND-projects/blob/3bced7f6c4d9fea2439df2ad6c9d8ff7986cb5b8/project1-navigation/navigation/dqn/utils/prioritybuffer.py#L13"><strong>__init__</strong></a>

methods, which we will analyze one by one.</p>

<ul>
<li>The constructor ( <strong>__init__</strong> ) instantiates the prioritized replay buffer
by copying the required hyperparameters, namely: \( e \) extra amount for priority
(recall \( p_{t} = \vert \delta_{t} \vert + e \) ), \( \alpha \) power to control
how priority affects the sample probability, \( \beta \) power to control the amount
of importance sampling used (annealed from given value up to 1), and the amount
\( \Delta \beta \) that the \( \beta \) factor increases every sampling call.
We also create the Sum Tree and the Min Tree as required for the sampling and
importance sampling calculation process.</li>
</ul>

using the Sum Tree and computing the importance sampling weights using both the

sampling random numbers inside bins over the whole union of priorities by querying
the Sum Tree with these random numbers. The importance sampling weights are computed
as explained earlier, and returned along the corresponding experience tuple for usage
in the SGD process during learning. We also return the indices in the tree that
correspond to these samples for later updates, as the Bellman Errors will be computed
for these experiences and updated after the SGD step has been taken (shown later
in the modifications to the core agent functionality).</li>

<h2 id="8-some-preliminary-tests-of-the-improvements">8. Some preliminary tests of the improvements</h2>

<p>In this section we show some preleminary results obtained with the improvements.
These results come from the following two extra experiments, which we made in order
to evaluate if PER and DDQN helped during training:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Experiment 2</strong> : Test vanilla DQN against each of the improvements (DDQN only, PER only and
                 DDQN + PER).</li>
<li><strong>Experiment 3</strong> : Test if DDQN + PER help in situations with too little exploration.
                 Our hypothesis was that too little exploration might run into unstable
                 learning, and DDQN + PER could help stabilize this process (or even
                 help solve it if the agent couldn't solve the task using only the baseline).</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: the hyperparameters related to PER were not exposed through the .json file
(sorry,I will fix it in later tests), but instead hard-coded in the priority-buffer
implementation (see the <a href="https://github.com/wpumacay/DeeprlND-projects/blob/master/project1-navigation/navigation/dqn/utils/prioritybuffer.py">prioritybuffer.py</a>
file). These parameters were set to the following default values:</p>

<pre><code>eps   : 0.01    # small value added to the absolute value of the bellman error
alpha : 0.6     # power to raise the priority in order to further control it
beta  : 0.4     # importance sampling annealed factor
dbeta : 0.00001 # linear increment per sample added to the &quot;beta&quot; parameter
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Spoiler alert</strong>: we did not find much improvement in the task at hand by using PER and
DDQN. However, these results are preliminary as we did not tune the hyperparameters
of PER (nor the other hyperparameters), and we still haven't made test cases for all
details of the implementations of the algorithm. We tested each separate component
of the improvements (extra data structures, consistency with other sources' implementations,
etc.), but still we could have miss some detail in the implementation. Also, perhaps
the structure of the task at hand is not too complicated for our vanilla DQN to require
these improvements. We plan to make further tests and experiments in this and more
complicated environments (visual banana environment, atari, etc.) to see if our improvements
actually work and help during training.</p>

<h3 id="81-experiment-2-testing-dqn-improvements-against-the-baseline">8.1 Experiment 2: Testing DQN improvements against the baseline</h3>

<p>This experiment consisted of testing what improvements do DDQN and PER offer to our
vanilla DQN implementation. The configurations for these can be found in the following
files:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/wpumacay/DeeprlND-projects/blob/master/project1-navigation/configs/config_agent_2_1.json"><strong>config_agent_2_1.json</strong></a> : Configuration with only DDQN active.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/wpumacay/DeeprlND-projects/blob/master/project1-navigation/configs/config_agent_2_2.json"><strong>config_agent_2_2.json</strong></a> : Configuration with only PER active.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/wpumacay/DeeprlND-projects/blob/master/project1-navigation/configs/config_agent_2_3.json"><strong>config_agent_2_3.json</strong></a> : Configuration with DDQN + PER active.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/wpumacay/DeeprlND-projects/blob/master/project1-navigation/configs/config_agent_1_1.json"><strong>config_agent_1_1.json</strong></a> : The baseline, with the same hyperparameters as the ones above.</li>
</ul>

<p>We used 5 runs and 2 different seeds for each configuration of the experiment. The
preliminary results (shown below) look very similar for all configurations, and we
can't conclude if there is any improvement using the variations to vanilla DQN.</p>

<h3 id="82-experiment-3-testing-dqn">8.2 Experiment 3: Testing DQN</h3>

<p>This experiment consisted on testing if DDQN + PER would help in situations where
there is too little exploration. The configurations used for these experiment can
be found in the following files:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/wpumacay/DeeprlND-projects/blob/master/project1-navigation/configs/config_agent_3_1.json"><strong>config_agent_3_1.json</strong></a> : Configuration without DDQN nor PER.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/wpumacay/DeeprlND-projects/blob/master/project1-navigation/configs/config_agent_3_2.json"><strong>config_agent_3_2.json</strong></a> : Configuration with DDQN + PER active.</li>
</ul>

<p>The exploration schedule was such that in just 60 episodes we would have reached
the fixed 0.01 minimum value for \( \epsilon \), and have just 18000 experience
tuples in a buffer of size of 131072, which consisted just of a approx. 13% of the
replay buffer size. All other interactions would add only experience tuples taken
from a practically greedy policy. Also, after just 510 episodes, the replay buffer
would have just experience tuples sampled from a greedy policy.</p>

<p>We considered that this case would require clever use of the data (PER) to squeeze
the most out of the experiences in the replay buffer, and also to not to overestimate
the q-values, as we would be following a pure greedy policy after just some steps.
The preliminary results don't show much evidence of improvement, except in a run
with a different seed, in which the learning curves were less jumpy, indicating
more stable learning. The results are shown in the image below, which were created
using 5 runs with 2 seeds for both configurations.</p>

<h2 id="9-final-remarks-and-future-improvements">9. Final remarks and future improvements</h2>

<p>In this post we tried to explain the DQN algorithm and how to use it to solve
the banana environment collector task from the ml-agents package. We also implemented
some improvements to the base DQN implementation, namely DDQN and PER. Some conclusions
we can get from this project would be the following:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Deep reinforcement learning via DQN is a very interesting approach to solve
control problems. Not control as in continuous control (which is a subject very
close to my heart 😄), as we are dealing with only discrete action spaces.
However, as we will see in the following projects, this approach of end-to-end
learning of behaviours can be scaled up to this environments that require continuous
state and action spaces (so stay tuned for the DDPG and PPO post for project 2 😄).</p></li>

<li><p>The additions made to action-value function approximation by the DQN authors
are quite important. We mentioned a case in which we messed up the soft-updates
and were effectively copying the full networks from one to another at a very
high frequency (every 4 steps, almost every single step). This is very similar
to the case of just using a single network (so no effective target-network).
In a sense we did an ablation test without realizing it 😄 (my bad). I'll
make more proper ablation tests as I update this post, like removing fixed-targets
and removing the replay-buffer.</p></li>

<li><p>We also did not mentioned it in a proper section, but we got some interesting behaviour
while working with the project. In some situations the agent got stuck during testing,
trying to go left and then right, stuck in an loop from which it could not recover (those
are the spikes that appear in the noisy plots, which appear very sporadically).
This behaviour is kind of similar to how a state-machine of a game agent gets stuck
because the programmer forgot to take into account some detail of the game (I've been
there quite some times 😢). For this situation I just made the MLP bigger
(give it a bigger high capacity model) and it started getting better performance
and got stuck less often, kind of like having more &quot;if-then soft rules&quot; to work
with that help take into account those details. This could be also caused because
various states of the environment are aliased, as we only have ray-casting observations
feed to a MLP, so perhaps using a recurrent model would help in this situation.</p></li>

<li><p>Also, there's some unexpected behaviour that we can see when we look at the q-values
visualizations during testing (see Figure 20). We expected to see a clear differences
between the max. q-value and the other q-values, but instead we can just see a small
margin that defines the actual action to choose. We haven't run the visualizer into
other environments to see if there's a clear distinction during inference, and we
consider that this might be caused by the nature of the environment (lunar-lander),
as perhaps in a given state you can actually get the same reward if any action is taken,
given that the next states will give you different situations that might yield to
more distinct q-values (imagine starting taking a bad action, but your policy let's
you recover, and in this situations you see a clear difference). We will try to further
analyze this in future updates to the post.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Finally, below we mention some of the improvements we consider making in following
updates to this post:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Make more tests of the improvements implemented, namely DDQN and PER, as we
did not see much improvement in the given task. We could run the implementation
in different environments from gym and atari, make &quot;unit tests&quot; for parts of the
implementation, and  tune the hyperparameters (PER) to see if there are any improvements.</p></li>

<li><p>Get the visual-based agent working for the banana environment. We had various issues
with the executable provided, namely memory leaks of the executable that used
up all memory in my machine. I first thought they were issues with the replay buffer
being to big (as the experiences now stored images), but after some debugging that
consisted on checking the system-monitor and even only testing the bare unity
environment in the most simple setting possible, i.e. just instantiating it and running
a random policy in a very simple script, we still got leaks that did not let us
fully test our implementation. I was considering sending a PR, but the leaks only
occur using the old ml-agent API (called unityagents, which is version 0.4.0).
We made a custom build in the latest version of unity ml-agents and the unity editor,
and got it working without leaks, but still could not get the agent to learn, which
might be caused by our DQN agent implementation, our model, or the custom build
we made.</p></li>

<li><p>Finish the implementation of a generic model for tensorflow and pytorch (see the
incomplete implementations in the model_pytorch.py and model_tensorflow.py files),
in order to be able to just send a configuration easily via a .json file or similar,
and instantiate the requested model without having to write any pytorch nor tensorflow
specific model by ourselves.</p></li>

<li><p>Implement the remaining improvements from rainbow, namely Dueling DQN, Noisy
DQN, A3C, Distributional DQN, and try to reproduce a similar ablation test in
benchmarks like gym and ml-agents.</p></li>

<li><p>Implement recurent versions of DQN and test the implementation in various environments.</p></li>

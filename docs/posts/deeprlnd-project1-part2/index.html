<h2 id="4-dqn-implementation">4. DQN Implementation</h2>

<p>At last, in this section we will cover the full implementation of the DQN algorithm
from [2] that uses soft-updates. This implementation is based on the original DQN
implementation from Deepmind (written in Torch and Lua), which can be found <a href="https://sites.google.com/a/deepmind.com/dqn/">here</a>.
Our implementation tries to decouple the key aspects of the algorithm from the model
itself in a kind of library-agnostic way (effectively decoupling the RL part from
the DL part). At the end of this section we will add some considerations we made
for our implementation.</p>

<p><strong>Disclaimer</strong>: the trained model has not been tested in the Bnana-Visual environment,
which provides as observations frames instead of the vector observations discussed
earlier. There might be some code that is related to the visual case which I've been
testing for a while, but I'm still debugging it. I'll update this post with the visual
case as well once I have it working properly.</p>

<h3 id="41-interfaces-and-concretions">4.1 Interfaces and Concretions</h3>

<p>Our implementation makes use of abstractions and decoupling, as we implemented
the algorithm from scratch. The main reason is that we wanted to grasp extra
details of the algorithm without following another implementation step by step
(and also to avoid having a pile of tf.ops to deal with or some pytorch specific
functionality laying around the core features of the algorithm 😄).</p>

<p>Just to be in the same page, by an <strong>Interface</strong> we mean a class that provides
a blueprint for other classes to extend. These interfaces could have declarations
of methods and data that their objects will use, but it does not implement them
(at least most of them) and leaves some <em>pure-virtual</em> methods to be implemented
by a child class. A <strong>Concretion</strong> is a specific class that extends the functionality
of this interface, and it has to implement the pure-virtual methods. For example,
our <strong>agent interface</strong> defines the functionality that is exposed by any <em>agent</em>
along with some code that all concretions should have (like the actual steps of
the DQN algorithm) but leaves some methods for the concrete agents, like the preprocess
method which is case specific; and an <strong>agent concretion</strong> could be an agent that
extends this functionality (and gains the common DQN implementation) but implements
its own version of the preprocess step.</p>

<p>The interfaces and some of its concretions are listed below:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Agent Interface</strong>, along concrete agents for <strong>BananaSimple</strong>, <strong>BananaVisual</strong> and <strong>Gridworld</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Model Interface</strong>, along concrete models for <strong>Pytorch</strong>, <strong>Tensorflow</strong> or a <strong>numpy q-table</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Memory Interface</strong>, along concrete buffers like <strong>ReplayBuffer</strong> and <strong>PriorityBuffer</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p>We wanted to make these interfaces as decoupled as possible from any Deep Learning
package, which allowed us to test each component separately (we did not want to
get into subtle bugs and poor performance due to specifics of the DL package). We
specially made use of this feature when testing the core agent interface with a simple
gridworld environment. This allowed us to find some bugs in our inplementation of the
steps in the DQN algorithm that might have taken us more time if considering also
the possibility that our DL model was buggy.</p>

<h3 id="42-agent-interface-and-concretions">4.2 Agent Interface and Concretions</h3>

<p>This interface has the implementation of the steps in the DQN algorithm, and has
as components the model and memory in order to query them as needed. This is an
&quot;Abstract Class&quot; in the sense that it shouldn't be instantiated. Instead, a specific
class that inherits from this interface has to implement the <strong>preprocess</strong> method.
Below we show this interface (only the methods, to give a sense of how this interface works),
which can be found in the <a href="https://github.com/wpumacay/DeeprlND-projects/blob/master/project1-navigation/navigation/dqn/core/agent.py">agent.py</a>
file in the <strong>dqn/core</strong> folder of the navigation package.</p>

<p>The key methods to be considered are the <strong>__init__</strong>, <strong>act</strong>, <strong>step</strong>, <strong>_preprocess</strong>
and <strong>_learn</strong> methods, which implement most of the required steps of the DQN algorithm.
We will discuss some of their details in snippets below, and we encourage the reader to
look at the full implementation using the hyperlinks provided. Some might have
some details removed (like dev. changes during testing), so they might look a bit
different than the originals from the repo.</p>

needs from a model, regardless of the specific Deep Learning library used. Unlike
the agent interface, which has some base code common to all agent types, this model
interface has no common code implementation, apart from some getters (as you can see
in the snippet below). The descriptions of all virtual methods that the backend-specific
models have to implement are :</p>

<li><strong>build</strong> : build the architecture of the model (either using keras or torch.nn).</li>
<li><strong>eval</strong>  : computes all q-values for a given state doing a forward pass.</li>

file contains a concrete implementation of the model interface using Tensorflow
as Deep Learning library. Below there is a snippet with most of the contents of
this file. The <strong>DqnModelTensorflow</strong> class serves a container for the Tensorflow
Ops created for the computation graph that implements the required evaluation and
training steps. For the architecture, instead of creating tf ops for each layer,
we decided to just use keras to create the required ops of the q-networks internally
(see the <em>createNetworkCustom</em> function), and then build on top of them by creating
other ops required for training and evaluation (see the <em>build</em> method). Because we
are creating a static graph beforehand it makes it easier to see where we are going to
have gradients being computed and used. If our model has its <strong>_trainable</strong> flag
set to false we then just create the required ops for evaluation only (used for
computing the TD-targets), whereas, if our model is trainable, we create the full
computation graph which goes from inputs (minibatch <span  class="math">\(\left \{ (s,a) \right \}\)</span>)
to the MSE loss using the estimates from the network and the TD-targets passed for training.</li>

<p>All the previously mentioned components are used via a single <a href="https://github.com/wpumacay/DeeprlND-projects/blob/master/project1-navigation/trainer.py"><strong>trainer</strong></a>,
which is in charge of all functionality used for training and evaluation, like:</p>

<ul>
<li>Creating the environment to be studied.</li>
<li>Implementing the RL loops for either training or testing.</li>
<li>Loading and saving configuration files for different tests.</li>
<li>Saving statistics from training for later analysis.</li>
</ul>

<p>Below there's a full snippet of the trainer.py file that implements this functionality:</p>

<p>This trainer came in handy when running various training sessions with different
configurations for some ablation tests (we did not mention it, but the agent
receives configuration objects that can be loaded and saved using <a href="https://github.com/wpumacay/DeeprlND-projects/tree/master/project1-navigation/configs">.json</a>
files).</p>

<p>Finally, note that we developed a <a href="https://github.com/wpumacay/DeeprlND-projects/blob/master/project1-navigation/navigation/envs/mlagents.py">small wrapper</a>
on top of our ml-agents environment itself, in order to make it follow a more standard
(and gym-like) way. Unity ml-agents has also an API for this, but as we are using
an older version of the library we might had run into some issues, so we decided
just to go with a simple env. wrapper and call it a day. Note that we also wanted
to go for a standard gym-like API in order to reuse a simple <a href="https://github.com/wpumacay/DeeprlND-projects/blob/master/project1-navigation/navigation/envs/gridworld.py">Gridworld</a>
env. for testing purposes.</p>

<h3 id="46-considerations-and-tradeoffs">4.6 Considerations and tradeoffs</h3>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Why not directly couple everything?, isn't it faster?</strong>: Well, sections that could
benefit from coupling would be sections that make heavy use of cpu-gpu transfers (kind of like
passing constantly tensors between cpu and gpu, so it could be faster to just leave them in gpu).
The only section so far that could benefit would be the TD-targets calculations, which
does evaluation in data from minibatches from memory in the current device (either cpu
or gpu) and then copies this data back to numpy ndarrays. We could actually write
more ops (in tensorflow) for the whole TD-target calculation and training all in
one pass, or avoid making copies from gpu to cpu from pytorch tensors, but the only
part that would benefit would be the TD-targets transfer, which is a batch of vectors.
Moreover, we wanted to make sure each piece of the DQN algorithm was working, so we
wanted to be able to test each piece separately.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Why not place everything in a notebook?</strong>: Short answer: it's not my usual workflow.
Long answer: I'd argue that doing it without notebooks can help you debug things easily,
specially when you don't have all modules already completed. I've used jupyter notebooks
for experiments and they're great for making experiments on top of already-made functionality
and for showing results (in fact, some of the results are accesible through some notebooks
in the repo), but for the full code I don't think they are the best option. Besides, I'd
argue that debugging issues using <strong>pdb</strong> (or in more detail using <strong>code</strong>) is way easier
and better than using a notebook (these tools really saved my day quite sometimes).
I'd suggest you give it a try as well by running your scripts in <em>debug</em> mode, as shown below.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="5-testing-and-choosing-hyperparameters">5. Testing and choosing hyperparameters</h2>

<p>In this section we discuss some of the steps we made in order to have a functional
implementation that could solve the task at hand. We had many issues to get it working,
so perhaps some of the steps we made could help you when making your own implementation.</p>

<h3 id="51-debugging-and-testing">5.1 Debugging and testing</h3>

<p>Initially, our implementation was supposed to be working on gym environments that
had a continuous state space and a discrete action space, being the environment
suggested for testing gym's LunarLander. We had various bugs before we could have
a working implementation of the DQN on this gym environment:</p>

<h3 id="crashes-everywhere-">Crashes everywhere :</h3>

<p>These issues where easier to fix. They where mostly due to our inexperience with
  the Deep learning package at hand. We decided to first implement the concrete
  model in PyTorch as we were already provided with a solution (by Udacity) that we
  could refer to in the worst case scenario. For this part, using <strong>pdb</strong> and running
  the scripts in debug mode helped a lot to debug shapes, arguments that some functions
  expected in some specific way (squeeze and unsqueeze here and there), etc.. PyTorch was a charm
  to work with because if something crashed we could just evaluate some tensors
  using pdb (or worst case using <strong>code</strong>). I'd suggest checking <a href="https://www.codementor.io/stevek/advanced-python-debugging-with-pdb-g56gvmpfa">this</a>
  post, which explains how to use pdb really well.</p>

<h3 id="simple-test-cases-">Simple test cases :</h3>

<p>Once everything ran without crashes, and after various passes to the code to check
  that everything should work fine, we decided to let the beast loose and destroy
  the task. Well, that didn't go that well, as I only ended up destroying a virtual
  lunar lander every episode. There were some bugs in the code that I just didn't
  notice, even after various passes to the code. This is were having a decouple
  and modularized implementation came in handy.</p>

<p>You see, it's a bit frustrating when you look at your code and everything seems
  fine but it just doesn't work, and you actually have lots of places you can check and
  knobs you can tune. Where the errors due to my hyperparameters?. Was there an error
  that might have slipped all my checks?. Hopefully, I had watched a <a href="https://youtu.be/8EcdaCk9KaQ">lecture</a>
  from the DeepRL bootcamp in which John Schulman discussed the nuts and bolts of DeepRL.
  A suggestion that saved my day was to test in a simple toy problem and then to
  start to scale up to the problem at hand. So, I happened to have a gridworld
  environment laying around that I knew that tabular q-learning should solve.</p>

      <figcaption class="center" >Figure 16. Some gridworlds used to test our implenentation</figcaption>
    
  </figure>



<p>In order to make our DQN agent work in this simple gridworld we just had to modify
the preprocess function such that each discrete state of the gridworld is converted
into a one-hot encoding state-vector representation for our network, as shown in
the following image.</p>


  <figure class="center" >

      <figcaption class="center" >Figure 17. One-hot encoding representation of each state (to serve as input to our network)</figcaption>
    
  </figure>



<p>After fixing our implementation, this is what we obtained as the Q-table, constructed
by evaluating the Q-network in the gridworld discrete states, which is what were expecting
(what tabular q-learning also returned for the same configurations).</p>

      <figcaption class="center" >Figure 18. Results after fixing the implenentation of DQN in the gridworld environments</figcaption>
    
  </figure>



<p>To train this, just use the <a href="https://github.com/wpumacay/DeeprlND-projects/blob/master/project1-navigation/trainer_full.py">trainer_full.py</a>
file (provided in the navigation package) as follows (for testing just replace &quot;train&quot;
with &quot;test&quot; once training is complete):</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash"># train a DQN-based agent with a MLP-model to solve gridworld
python trainer_full.py train --gridworld=true

# ... After training is completed

# test the trained model
python trainer_full.py test --gridworld=true
</code></pre>

<p>We then tried our implementation with some of the gym environments, specifically
the Lunar Lander environment. Our implementation worked correctly on this environment
after the fixes to the issues found using the gridworld test-case. The hyperparameters
were set to roughly the same values found on the baseline of the <a href="https://github.com/udacity/deep-reinforcement-learning/blob/dc65050c8f47b365560a30a112fb84f762005c6b/dqn/solution/dqn_agent.py#L11">Udacity DQN example</a>.
An example of the working agent is shown below:</p>

<p>To train this, just use the <a href="https://github.com/wpumacay/DeeprlND-projects/blob/master/project1-navigation/trainer_full.py">trainer_full.py</a>
as well in the following way (for testing just replace &quot;train&quot; with &quot;test&quot; once
training is complete):</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash"># train a DQN-based agent with a MLP-model to solve LunarLander-v2
python trainer_full.py train --gym=LunarLander-v2

# ... After training is completed

# test the trained model
python trainer_full.py test --gym=LunarLander-v2
</code></pre>

<p>Finally, we also tried to visualize the decision making process during runtime,
so we made some simple visualization helpers to plot the Q-values for each action,
and the V-value for each state (following the greedy policy).</p>

<h3 id="52-choosing-hyperparameters">5.2 Choosing hyperparameters</h3>

<p>The hyperparameters were tuned from the starting hyperparameters of the DQN solution
provided for the Lunar Lander. We didn't run exhaustive tests (neither grid nor random
search) to tune the hyperparameters, but just incrementally increased/decreased
some hyperparameters we considered important:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Replay Buffer size</strong>: too low of a replay buffer size (around \( 10^{4} \)) gave
us poor performance even though we made various changes in the other hyperparameters
to make it work. We then decided to gradually increase it until it could more or less
solve the task, and finally set it at around \( 10^{5} \) in size.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Epsilon schedule</strong>: We exponentially decreased exploration via a decay factor applied
at every end of episode, and keeping \( \epsilon \) fixed thereafter. Low exploration
over all training steps led to poor performance, so we gradually increased it until
we started getting good performance. The calculations we made to consider how much to increase
were based on for how long would the exploration be active (until fixed at a certain value),
how many training steps were available and how big was our replay buffer.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>All other hyperparameters were kept roughly to the same values as the baseline provided
by the DQN solution from Udacity, as based on these values they provided some initial
training curves that showed that with their configuration we should be able to get
good results.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The max. number of steps was kept fixed to the baseline value provided, as they showed
that at max. 1800 steps a working solution should be able to already solve the task.</p></li>

<li><p>The learning rate and soft-updates factor was kept also the same as the baseline, as
we consider these values to be small enough to not introduce instabilities during learning.
We actually had an issue related to a wrong interpolation which made learning stable
for test cases like lunar lander, but unstable for the banana environment. We were
using as update rule <span  class="math">\(\theta^{-} := \tau \theta^{-} + (1-\tau) \theta\)</span>, but the
correct update rule was <span  class="math">\(\theta^{-} := (1-\tau) \theta^{-} + \tau \theta\)</span>. As
we were using a very small <span  class="math">\(\tau\)</span>, we were effectively running our experiements
with hard-updates at a very high frequency (1 update per 4 steps) instead of soft-updates.
This seemed to be working fine for the Lunar Lander environment (we increased <span  class="math">\(\tau\)</span>
to make it work), but didn't work at all in the banana environment.</p></li>

<li><p>The minibatch size was kept the same (64). As we are not using any big network
nor using high dimensional inputs (like images) we don't actually have to worry much
about our GPU being able to allocate resources for a bigger batch (so we could have set
a bigger batch size), but we decided it to keep it that way. It would be interesting
though to see the effect that the batch size has during learning. Of course, it'd take
a bit longer to take a SGD step, but perhaps by taking a &quot;smoother&quot; gradient step we could get better/smoother learning.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="6-results-of-dqn-on-the-banana-collector-environment">6. Results of DQN on the Banana Collector Environment</h2>

<p>In this section we show the results of our submission, which were obtained through
various runs and with various seeds. The results are presented in the form of <em>time
series plots</em> each over a single run, and <em>standard deviation</em> plots over a set of
similar runs. We will also show the results of one of three experiments we made with
different configurations. This experiment did not include the improvements (DDQN, PER),
which are going to be explained in a later section. The results can be found also
in the <a href="https://github.com/wpumacay/DeeprlND-projects/blob/master/project1-navigation/results_analysis.ipynb">results_analysis.ipynb</a>.
However, due to the size of the training sessions, we decided not to upload most
of the results (apart from a single run for the submission) due to the file size
of the combined training sessions. Still, to reproduce the same experiments just
run the provided bash scripts:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>training_submission.sh</strong> : to run the base experiments for the submissions</li>
<li><strong>training_tests_1.sh</strong> : to run the first experiment, related to \( \epsilon \) tests</li>
<li><strong>training_tests_2.sh</strong> : to run the second experiment, related to how much the improvements (DDQN and PER) to DQN help.</li>
<li><strong>training_tests_3.sh</strong> : to run the third experiment, to check if our implementations of DDQN and PER actually helps in some setups with little exploration.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="61-results-with-the-configuration-for-the-submission">6.1 Results with the configuration for the submission</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Single runs</strong>: We choose one of the results of the various runs, plotted as time
series plots. The x-axis represents episodes (during training) and the y-axis represents
the score obtained at that episode. Also, the noisy blue plot is the actual score per episode,
whereas the red curve is a smoothed (running average) curve from the previous one with a
window of size 100. Below we show one random run from the episode (not cherry-picked)
for both our pytorch and tensorflow implementations. As we can see, the agent
successfully solves the environment at around episode 900. Note that this submission
configuration is not the best configuration (hyperparameters tuned to squeeze the
most score out of the environment), but a configuration we considered appropriate
(moderate exploration). We found that for more aggressive exploration schedules
(fast decay over around 300 episodes) and a moderate sized replay buffer the task
could be solved in around 300 steps (see experiment 1 later).</li>
</ul>

<!--The results are pretty uniform along random seeds. Of course, this might be caused
by the nature of the algorithm itself. I was expecting some variability, as mentioned
in [this](https://youtu.be/Vh4H0gOwdIg?t=1133) lecture on reproducibility. Perhaps
we don't find that much variability because of the type of methods we are using,
namely Q-learning which is off-policy. Most of the algorithms studied in the
lecture were on-policy and based on policy gradients, which depend on the policy
for the distribution of data they see. This might cause the effect of exploring
and finding completely different regions due to various variabilities (different
seeds, different implementations, etc.). Perhaps this might be caused as well--></li>

<h3 id="62-experiment-1-tweaking-exploration">6.2 Experiment 1: tweaking exploration</h3>

<p>In this experiment we tried to double-check if decreasing the amount of exploration
would allow the agent to solve the task in fewer episodes. Because the amount of exploration
is small, the agent would be forced to start trusting more its own estimates early on
and, if the setup is right (big enough replay buffer, etc.), this might have the
effect of making the agent solve the task quickly. The configurations used are the
following:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://github.com/wpumacay/DeeprlND-projects/blob/master/project1-navigation/configs/config_agent_1_1.json"><strong>config_agent_1_1.json</strong></a> :
This configuration has a moderate exploration schedule. We decay \( \epsilon \)
from 1.0 to 0.01 using a multiplicative decay factor of 0.9975 applied per episode.
This schedule makes \( \epsilon \) decay from 1.0 to approx. 0.1 over 1000 episodes,
and to the final value of 0.01 over approx. 1600 episodes.</p></li>

<li><p><a href="https://github.com/wpumacay/DeeprlND-projects/blob/master/project1-navigation/configs/config_agent_1_2.json"><strong>config_agent_1_2.json</strong></a> :
This configuration has a little more aggresive exploration schedule. We decay \( \epsilon \)
from 1.0 to 0.01 using a multiplicative decay factor of 0.98 applied per episode.
This schedule makes \( \epsilon \) decay from 1.0 to approx. 0.1 over 100 episodes,
and to the final value of 0.01 over approx. 200 episodes.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Below we show the training results from 5 runs over 2 random seeds using these
configurations. These plots reveal a trend which suggests that with the second
configuration (less exploration) we get to solve the task faster (around 400 episodes)
than the first configuration (around 900 episodes).</p>

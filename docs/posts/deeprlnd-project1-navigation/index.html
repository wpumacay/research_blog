<h2 id="1-description-of-the-banana-collector-environment">1. Description of the Banana Collector Environment</h2>

<p>The environment chosen for the project was a <strong>modified version of the Banana
Collector Environment</strong> from the Unity ML-Agents toolkit. The original version
can be found <a href="https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/docs/Learning-Environment-Examples.md#banana-collector">here</a>,
and our version consists of a custom build provided by Udacity with the following
description:</p>

<ul>
<li>A single agent that can move in a planar arena, with <strong>observations</strong> given by
a set of distance-based sensors and some intrinsic measurements, and <strong>actions</strong>
consisting of 4 discrete commands.</li>
<li>A set of NPCs consisting of bananas of two categories: <strong>yellow bananas</strong>, which give the
agent a <strong>reward of +1</strong>, and <strong>purple banans</strong>, which give the agent a <strong>reward of -1</strong>.</li>
<li>The task is <strong>episodic</strong>, with a maximum of 300 steps per episode.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="11-agent-observations">1.1 Agent observations</h3>

<p>The observations the agent gets from the environment come from the <strong>agent's linear velocity</strong>
in the plane (2 entries), and a <strong>set of 7 ray perceptions</strong>. These ray perceptions consist
of rays shot in certain fixed directions from the agent. Each of these perceptions
returns a vector of <strong>5 entries each</strong>, whose values are explained below:</p>

<ul>
<li>The first 4 entries consist of a one-hot encoding of the type of object the ray hit, and
these could either be a yellow banana, a purple banana, a wall or nothing at all.</li>
<li>The last entry consist of the percent of the ray length at which the object was found. If
no object is found at least at this maximum length, then the 4th entry is set to 1, and this
entry is set to 0.0.</li>
</ul>

<p>Below there are two separate cases that show the ray-perceptions. The first one
to the left shows all rays reaching at least one object (either purple banana, yellow
banana or a wall) and also the 7 sensor reading in array form (see the encodings in the
4 first entries do not contain the <em>none found</em> case). The second one to the right
shows all but one ray reaching an object and also the 7 sensor readings in array form (see
the encodings in the 4 first entrines do include the <em>none found</em> case for the 4th perception).</p>


  <figure class="center" >
    <img src="/imgs/img_banana_env_observations.png"  alt="fig-banana-agent-ray-observations"   style="border-radius: 8px;"  />
    
      <figcaption class="center"  style="color: black;" >Figure 2. Agent ray-perceptions. a) 7 rays reaching at least one object (banana or wall). b) One rayreaching the max. length before reaching any object</figcaption>
    
  </figure>



<p>All these measurements account for an observation consisting of a vector with
37 elements. This vector observation will be the representation of the state of
the agent in the environment that we will use as input to the Q-network, which
will be discussed later.</p>

<h4 id="note"><strong>Note</strong></h4>

<p>This representation is applicable only to our custom build (provided
by Udacity), as the original Banana Collector from ML-Agents consists of a vector
observation of 53 entries. The rays in the original environment give extra information
about the current state of the agent (the agent in the original environment can shoot and
be shot), which give 2 extra measurements, and the rays give also information about
neighbouring agents (2 extra measurements per ray).</p>

<p>If curious, you can take a look at the C# implementation in the UnitySDK folder
of the ML-Agents repository. See the <em>'CollectObservations'</em> method (shown below)
in the <a href="https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/37d139af636e4a2351751fbf0f2fca5a9ed7457f/UnitySDK/Assets/ML-Agents/Examples/BananaCollectors/Scripts/BananaAgent.cs#L44">BananaAgent.cs</a>
file. This is helpfull in case you want to create a variation of the environment
for other purposes other than this project.</p>

<pre><code class="language-Csharp">    public override void CollectObservations()
    {
        if (useVectorObs)
        {
            float rayDistance = 50f;
            float[] rayAngles = { 20f, 90f, 160f, 45f, 135f, 70f, 110f };
            string[] detectableObjects = { &quot;banana&quot;, &quot;agent&quot;, &quot;wall&quot;, &quot;badBanana&quot;, &quot;frozenAgent&quot; };
            AddVectorObs(rayPer.Perceive(rayDistance, rayAngles, detectableObjects, 0f, 0f));
            Vector3 localVelocity = transform.InverseTransformDirection(agentRb.velocity);
            AddVectorObs(localVelocity.x);
            AddVectorObs(localVelocity.z);
            AddVectorObs(System.Convert.ToInt32(frozen));
            AddVectorObs(System.Convert.ToInt32(shoot));
        }
    }
</code></pre>

<h3 id="12-agent-actions">1.2 Agent actions</h3>

<p>The actions that the agent can take consist of 4 discrete actions that serve as
commands for the movement of the agent in the plane. The indices for each of these
actions are the following :</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Action 0</strong>: Move forward.</li>
<li><strong>Action 1</strong>: Move backward.</li>
<li><strong>Action 2</strong>: Turn left.</li>
<li><strong>Action 3</strong>: Turn right.</li>
</ul>

<p>Figure 3 shows these four actions that conform the discrete action space of the
agent.</p>


  <figure class="center" >
    <img src="/imgs/img_banana_env_actions.png"  alt="fig-banana-agent-actions"   style="border-radius: 8px;"  />
    
      <figcaption class="center"  style="color: black;" >Figure 3. Agent actions.</figcaption>
    
  </figure>



<h4 id="note-1"><strong>Note</strong></h4>

<p>These actions are applicable again only for our custom build, as the original
environment from ML-Agents has even more actions, using action tables (newer API).
This newer API accepts in most of the cases a tuple or list for the actions, with
each entry representing corresponding to a specific action table (a nested set of
actions) that the agent can take. For example, for the original banana collector
environment the actions passed should be:</p>

<pre><code class="language-python"># actions are of the form: [actInTable1, actInTable2, actINTable3, actInTable4]

# move forward
action = [ 1, 0, 0, 0 ]
# move backward
action = [ 2, 0, 0, 0 ]
# mode sideways left
action = [ 0, 1, 0, 0 ]
# mode sideways right
action = [ 0, 2, 0, 0 ]
# turn left
action = [ 0, 0, 1, 0 ]
# turn right
action = [ 0, 0, 2, 0 ]
</code></pre>

<h3 id="13-environment-dynamics-and-rewards">1.3 Environment dynamics and rewards</h3>

<p>The agent spawns randomly in the plane of the arena, which is limited by walls. Upon
contact with a banana (either yellow or purple) the agents receives the appropriate reward
(+1 or -1 depending on the banana). The task is considered solved once the agent
can consistently get an awerage reward of <strong>+13</strong> over 100 episodes.</p>

<h2 id="2-accompanying-code-and-setup">2. Accompanying code and setup</h2>

<p>The code for our submission is hosted on <a href="https://github.com/wpumacay/DeeprlND-projects/tree/master/project1-navigation">github</a>.
The <a href="https://github.com/wpumacay/DeeprlND-projects/blob/master/project1-navigation/README.md">README.md</a>
file already contains the instruction of how to setup the environment, but we repeat them
here for completeness (and to save you a tab in your browser 😆).</p>

<h3 id="21-custom-environment-build">2.1 Custom environment build</h3>

<p>The environment provided is a custom build of the ml-agents Banana Collector
environment, with the features described in the earlier section. The environment
is provided as an executable which we can download from the links below according
to our platform:</p>

<p>Keep the .zip file where you downloaded it for now. We will later explain where
to extract its contents when finishing the setup.</p>

<h3 id="note-2"><strong>Note</strong></h3>

<p>The executables provided are compatible only with an older version of the ML-Agents
toolkit (version 0.4.0). The setup below will take care of this, but keep in mind
if you want to use the executable on your own.</p>

<h3 id="22-dependencies">2.2 Dependencies</h3>

<p>As already mentioned, the environment provided is an instance of an ml-agents
environment and as such it requires the <strong>appropriate</strong> ml-agents python API to be
installed in order to interact with it. There are also some other dependencies, so
to facilitate installation all this setup is done by installing the <strong>navigation</strong>
package from the accompanying code, which we will discuss later. Also, there is no need
to download the Unity Editor for this project (unless you want to do a custom build
for your platform) because the builds for the appropriate platforms are already
provided for us.</p>

<h3 id="23-downloading-accompanying-code-and-finishing-setup">2.3 Downloading accompanying code and finishing setup</h3>

<ul>
<li>Grab the accompanying code from the github repo.</li>

<h2 id="3-an-overview-of-the-dqn-algorithm">3. An overview of the DQN algorithm</h2>

<p>As mentioned in the title, our agent is based on the DQN agent introduced in the
<a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/deepmind-media/dqn/DQNNaturePaper.pdf"><strong>Human-level control through deep reinforcement learning</strong></a>
paper by Mnih, et. al. We will give a brief description of the algorithm in this section,
which is heavily based on Sutton and Barto's <a href="http://incompleteideas.net/book/RLbook2018.pdf">book</a>.
For completeness we will start with a brief introduction to reinforcement learning, and
then give the full description of the DQN algorithm.</p>

<h3 id="31-rl-concepts">3.1 RL concepts</h3>

<p>Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a learning approach in which an <strong>Agent</strong> learns by
<strong>trial and error</strong> while interacting with an <strong>Environment</strong>. The core setup is shown
in Figure 1, where we have an agent in a certain <strong>state</strong> \( S_{t} \)
interacting with an environment by applying some <strong>action</strong> \( A_{t} \).
Because of this interaction, the agent receives a <strong>reward</strong> \( R_{t+1} \) from
the environment and it also ends up in a <strong>new state</strong> \( S_{t+1} \).</p>


  <figure class="center" >
    <img src="/imgs/img_rl_loop.png"  alt="img-rl-loop"   style="border-radius: 8px;"  />
    
      <figcaption class="center"  style="color: black;" >Figure 4. RL interaction loop</figcaption>
    
  </figure>



<p>This can be further formalize using the framework of Markov Decision Proceses (MDPs).
Using this framework we can define our RL problem as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A Markov Decision Process (MDP) is defined as a tuple of the following components:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>A state space</strong> \( \mathbb{S} \) of configurations \( s_{t} \) for an agent.</li>
<li><strong>An action space</strong> \( \mathbb{A} \) of actions \( a_{t} \) that the agent can take in the environment.</li>
<li><strong>A transition model</strong> \( p(s',r | s,a) \) that defines the distribution of states
that an agent can land on and rewards it can obtain \( (s',r) \) by taking an
action \( a \) in a state \( s \).</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>The objective of the agent is to maximize the <strong>total sum of rewards</strong> that it can
get from its interactions, and because the environment can potentially be stochastic
(recall that the transition model defines a probability distribution) the objective
is usually formulated as an <strong>expectation</strong> ( \( \mathbb{E}  \) ) over the random
variable defined by the total sum of rewards. Mathematically, this objective is
described as follows.</p>

<p><span  class="math">\[
\mathbb{E} \left \{ r_{t+1} + r_{t+2} + r_{t+3} + \dots \right \}
\]</span></p>

<p>Notice the expectation is over the sum of a sequence of rewards. This sequence comes
from a <strong>trajectory</strong> (\( \tau \)) that the agent defines by interacting with the environment
in a sequential manner.</p>

<p><span  class="math">\[
\tau = \left \{ (s_{0},a_{0},r_{1}),(s_{1},a_{1},r_{2}),\dots,(s_{t},a_{t},r_{t+1}),\dots \right \}
\]</span></p>

<p>Tasks that always give finite-size trajectories can be defined as <strong>episodic</strong> (like games),
whereas tasks that go on forever are defined as <strong>continuous</strong> (like life itself). The
task we are dealing in this post is episodic, and the length of an episode (max. length
of any trajectory) is 300 steps.</p>

<p>There is a slight addition to the objective defined earlier that is often used: <strong>the discount factor</strong>
\( \gamma \). This factor tries to take into account the effect that a same ammount
of reward in the far future should be less interesting to the agent than the same
amount now (kind of like interest rates when dealing with money). We introduce
this by multiplying each reward by a power of this factor to the number of steps
into the future.</p>

<p><span  class="math">\[
\mathbb{E} \left \{ r_{t+1} + \gamma r_{t+2} + \gamma^{2} r_{t+3} + \dots \right \}
\]</span></p>

<p><strong>Sidenote</strong>: <em>The most important reason we use discounting is for mathematical
convenience, as it allows to keep our objective from exploding in the non-episodic
case (to derive this, just replace each \( r_{t} \) for the maximum reward \( r_{max} \),
and sum up the geometric series). There is another approach which deals with the <a href="https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2FBF00114727.pdf">undiscounted
average reward setting</a>.
This approach leads to a different set of bellman equations from the ones that are normally
studied, and therefore different algorithms.</em></p>

<p>A solution to the RL problem consists of a <strong>Policy</strong> \( \pi \), which is a mapping
from the current state we are ( \( s_{t} \) ) to an appropriate action ( \( a_{t} \) )
from the action space. Such mapping is basically a function, and we can define it as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A <strong>deterministic</strong> policy is a mapping \( \pi : \mathbb{S} \rightarrow \mathbb{A} \)
that returns an action to take \( a_{t} \) from a given state \( s_{t} \).</p>

<p><span  class="math">\[
a_{t} = \pi(s_{t})
\]</span></p>
</blockquote>

<p>We could also define an stochastic policy which, instead of returning an action
\( a_{t} \) in a certain situation given by the state \( s_{t} \), it returns
a distribution over all possible actions that can be taken in that situation
\( a_{t} \sim \pi(.|s_{t}) \).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A <strong>stochastic</strong> policy is a mapping \( \pi : \mathbb{S} \times \mathbb{A} \rightarrow \mathbb{R} \)
that returns a distribution over actions \( a_{t} \) to take from a given state \( s_{t} \).</p>

<p><span  class="math">\[
a_{t} \sim \pi(.|s_{t})
\]</span></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Our objective can then be formulated as follows: <strong>find a policy \( \pi \) that maximizes
the expected discounted sum of rewards</strong>.</p>

<p><span  class="math">\[
\max_{\pi} \mathbb{E}_{\pi} \left \{ r_{t+1} + \gamma r_{t+2} + \gamma^{2} r_{t+3} + \dots \right \}
\]</span></p>

<p>To wrap up this section we will introduce three more concepts that we will use
throughout the rest of this post: <strong>returns</strong> \( G \), <strong>state-value functions</strong>
\( V(s) \) and <strong>action-value functions</strong> \( Q(s,a) \).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The return \( G_{t} \) is defined as the discounted sum of rewards obtained
over a trajectory from time step \( t \) onwards.</p>

<p><span  class="math">\[
G_{t} = r_{t+1} + \gamma r_{t+2} + \gamma^{2} r_{t+3} + \dots = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \gamma^{k} r_{t+k+1}
\]</span></p>
</blockquote>

<p>By using the return we can write the objective of the agent in a more compact way,
as follows:</p>

<p><span  class="math">\[
\max_{\pi} \mathbb{E}_{\pi} \left \{ G_{t} \right \}
\]</span></p>

<blockquote>
<p>The state-value function \( V_{\pi}(s) \) is defined as the expected return that
an agent can get if it starts at state \( s_{t} = s \) and then follows policy

<p>This function \( V_{\pi}(s) \) serves as a kind of <strong>intuition of how well a certain
state is if we are following a specific policy</strong>. The figure below (taken from the DQN paper [2])
illustrates this more clearly with the game of breakout as an example. The agent's
state-value function on the bottom part of the figure shows that in the state in which
the agent makes a hole in the bricks its estimation of the value greatly increases
(section labeled with <em>4</em>) in the graph.</p>

with the game of pong as an example. The agent's action-value function tell us how
well is a certain action in a certain situation, and as you can see in the states labeled

the other two actions.</p>

<h3 id="32-rl-solution-methods">3.2 RL solution methods</h3>

<p>There are various methods that we can use to solve this problem. The figure below (from [3])
shows a taxonomy of the available approaches and methods within each approach. We will
be following the Value-based approach, in which we will try to obtain the optimal
action-value function \( Q^{\star} \).</p>

  </figure>



<p>Value based methods are based on the <strong>Bellman Equations</strong>, which specify what the
optimal state-value and action-value functions should satisfy in order to be optimal.
Below we show the <strong>Bellman Optimality Equation</strong> for \( Q^{\star} \), and the solution
\( Q^{\star} \) of this equation is a fixed point that can be computed exactly using
<em>Dynamic Drogramming</em> (if a model of the environment is known) or approximately
with <em>Monte Carlo</em> and <em>Temporal Difference</em> methods (if no model of the environment
is available).</p>

<p><span  class="math">\[
Q^{\star}(s,a) = \mathbb{E}_{(s,a,s',r)} \left \{ r + \gamma \max_{a'} Q^{\star}(s',a') \right \}
\]</span></p>

<h3 id="33-tabular-qlearning">3.3 Tabular Q-learning</h3>

<p>The method we will use is called Q-learning, which is a model-free method that
recovers \( Q^{\star} \) from experiences using the following update rule:</p>

<p><span  class="math">\[
Q(s,a) := \overbrace{Q(s,a)}^{\text{Current estimate}} + \alpha ( \overbrace{r + \gamma \max_{a'} Q(s',a')}^{\text{"Better" estimate}} - Q(s,a) )
\]</span></p>

<p>This update rule is used in the <strong>tabular case</strong>, which is used when dealing with discrete state
and action spaces. These cases allow to easily represent the action-value function in
a table (numpy array or dictionary), and update each entry of this table separately.</p>

<p>For example, consider a simple MDP with \( \mathbb{S}=0,1\) and \( \mathbb{A}=0,1\).
The action-value function could be represented with the following table.</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>State (s)</th>
<th>Action (a)</th>
<th>Q-value Q(s,a)</th>
</tr>
</thead>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td>0</td>
<td>0</td>
<td>Q(0,0)</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>0</td>
<td>1</td>
<td>Q(0,1)</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td>0</td>
<td>Q(1,0)</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td>1</td>
<td>Q(1,1)</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>In python we could just use :</p>

<pre><code class="language-Python"># define a Q-table initialized with zeros (using numpy)
import numpy as np
Q = np.zeros( (nStates, nActions), dtype = np.float32 )

# define a Q-table initialized with zeros (using dictionaries)
from collections import defaultdict
Q = defaultdict( lambda : np.zeros( nActions ) )
</code></pre>

<p>The Q-learning algorithm for the tabular case is shown below, and it basically
consists of updating the estimate of the q-value \( Q(s,a) \) for the state-action
pair \( (s,a) \) from another estimate of the true q-value of the optimal policy given by
\( r + \gamma \max_{a'} Q(s',a') \) called the <strong>TD-Target</strong>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Q-learning (off-policy TD control)</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Algorithm parameters: step size \( \alpha \in [0,1] \), small \( \epsilon \gt 0 \)</li>

<li><p>Initialize q-table \( Q(s,a) \) for all \( s \in \mathbb{S}, a \in \mathbb{A} \)</p></li>

<h3 id="34-function-approximation">3.4 Function approximation</h3>

<p>The tabular case provides a nice way to solve our problem, but at the cost of storing
a big table with one entry per possible \( (s,a) \) pair. This is not scalable to
larger state spaces, which is the case for continous spaces. One approach would be
to discretize the state space into bins for various \( (s,a) \), treat each bin as
an entry for the table and then solve as in the tabular case. However this is not
practical for various reasons :</p>

<ul>
<li>As the discretization gets more precise we end up with more bins and our table
explodes in size. This is an exponential explosion due to the <strong>curse of dimensionality</strong>.</li>
<li>Each possible \( (s,a) \) is stored separately and updated separately, which
doesn't take into account the fact that nearby \( (s,a) \) pairs should have
similar \( Q(s,a) \) values. This means we are not generalizing our knowledge of
one pair to nearby pairs.</li>
</ul>

<p>To solve these issues we make use of function approximators like linear models,
radial basis functions, neural networks, etc., which allow us to scale up to high
dimensional spaces and &quot;generalize&quot; over these spaces.</p>

<p>Building on top of the previous Q-learning algorithm, we can write an algorithm to
obtain the action-value function using function approximation. In this case we
parametrize our action-value function as \( Q_{\theta}(s,a) \) where \( \theta \)
are the parameters of the function approximator, e.g. the weights of a neural network.
Recall from tabular Q-learning that the update rule tried to improve an estimate of
a q-value \( Q(s,a) \) from another estimate \( r + \gamma \max_{a'} Q(s',a') \)
which we called TD-target. This was necessary as we did not have a true value for the
q-value at \( (s,a) \), so we had to use a guess.</p>

<p>Suppose we have access to the actual q-value for all \( (s,a) \) possible pairs.
We could then use this true q-value and make our estimates become these true q-values.
In the tabular case we could just replace these for each entry, and for the function
approximation case we make something similar: What do we do if we have the true values
(or labels) that our model has to give for some inputs?. Well, we just <strong>fit</strong> our model
to the data <strong>like in supervised learning</strong>.</p>

<p><span  class="math">\[
\theta = \argmin_{\theta} \mathbb{E}_{(s,a) \sim D} \left \{ ( Q^{\star}(s,a) - Q_{\theta}(s,a) )^{2} \right \}
\]</span></p>

<p>If our function approximator is differentiable we then could just use <strong>Gradient Descent</strong>
to obtain the parameters \( \theta \) of our model:</p>

<p><span  class="math">\[
\theta := \theta - \frac{1}{2} \alpha \nabla_{\theta} \mathbb{E}_{(s,a) \sim D} \left \{ ( Q^{\star}(s,a) - Q_{\theta}(s,a) )^{2} \right \} \\
\rightarrow \theta := \theta - \frac{1}{2} \alpha \mathbb{E}_{(s,a) \sim D} \left \{ \nabla_{\theta}( Q^{\star}(s,a) - Q_{\theta}(s,a) )^{2} \right \} \\
\rightarrow \theta := \theta + \alpha \mathbb{E}_{(s,a) \sim D} \left \{ (Q^{\star}(s,a) - Q_{\theta}(s,a)) \nabla_{\theta}Q_{\theta}\vert_{(s,a)} \right \} \\
\]</span></p>

<p>Or, if using <strong>Stochastic Gradient Descent</strong> (SGD) :</p>

<p><span  class="math">\[
\theta := \theta + \alpha (Q^{\star}(s,a) - Q_{\theta}(s,a)) \nabla_{\theta}Q_{\theta}\vert_{(s,a)}
\]</span></p>

<p>Unfortunately, we do not have an oracle that would tell us the true q-values for
each possible \( (s,a) \) pair. Here we use a similar approach to tabular Q-learning,
namely use an estimate of the true q-value to update our current estimate. This estimate
of the true q-value was our TD-target, so we could just replace it in the SGD update rule
derived before:</p>

<p><span  class="math">\[
\theta := \theta + \alpha (r + \gamma \max_{a'}Q_{\theta}(s',a') - Q_{\theta}(s,a)) \nabla_{\theta}Q_{\theta}\vert_{(s,a)}
\]</span></p>

<p>This yields the following algorithm:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Action-Value function approximation</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Parameters</strong>: learning rate \( \alpha \in [0,1] \), small \( \epsilon \gt 0 \)</li>

<li><p>Initialize a parametrized action-value function \( Q_{\theta} \)</p></li>

<li><p>For each episode:</p>

<ul>
<li>Sample initial state \( s_{0} \) from the starting distribution</li>

<p>This algorithm forms the basis of the DQN agent, which adds various improvements
on top of this base algorithm. These improvements help to stabilize learning as
there are various issues when using the Vanilla version of this algorithm directly
with a Deep Neural Network as a function approximator.</p>

<h3 id="35-deep-qlearning">3.5 Deep Q-Learning</h3>

<p>At last, this section will describe the Deep Q-Learning algorithm, which builds
on top of the algorithm previously described.</p>

<h3 id="351-endtoend-learning">3.5.1 End-to-end learning</h3>

<p>A key issue we did not discussed in the previous section was how we used these
function approximators, which is actually a similar story to the previous techniques
used in Computer Vision before Deep Learning came back to life.</p>

<p>Usually when using a function approximator the inputs to this model are not direct
raw sensory data, but some intermediate representation in the form of features. These
features had to be carefully engineered for the specific task at hand (like in the
case of Computer Vision). Fortunately, we can use Deep Learning to help us come
with the right internal features required for the problem we are trying to solve,
as shown in the image below.</p>

  </figure>



<p>Similarly, we can combine Deep Learning (as powerful function approximators) with
Reinforcement Learning into a similar pipeline that would allow the agent learn
the required representations to solve the task at hand.</p>

  </figure>



<p>However, unlike supervised learning, the RL setup forces us to deal with sequential
data, which break the i.i.d. assumption (independent and identically distributed).
This brings correlations in the data that break direct vanilla approaches (just
replacing the function approximator with a deep network, and hoping for the best).
Moreover, unlike the tabular setup, there are no convergence guarantees for our
algorithms when using non-linear function approximators (see Chapter 11 in [1]).</p>

<p>To solve part of these issues, the authors in [2] developed various improvements
to the Vanilla setting that helped stabilize learning and break these annoying
correlations: <strong>Experience Replay</strong> and <strong>Fixed Targets</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="352-dqn-experience-replay">3.5.2 DQN: Experience Replay</h3>

<p>Experience replay is a mechanism introduced in [2] and it consists of <strong>Learning from
past stored experiences during replay sessions</strong>. Basically, we remember our experiences
in memory (called a replay buffer) and learn from them later. This allows us make more
efficient use of past experiences by not throwing away samples right away, and it also helps
to break one type of correlations: sequential correlations between experiences
\( (s_{t},a_{t},r_{t+1},s_{t+1}) \). In Figure 11 we try to depict this type of correlation
by showing 3 consecutive experience tuples along a trajectory. Assuming we are doing
one gradient update with each tuple using SGD we are then pushing our learned weights
according to the reward obtained (recall the td-target is used as a true estimate for
our algorithm). So, we are effectively pushing our weights using each sample, which
in turn depended on the previous one (both reward and next state).</p>


  <figure class="center" >
    <img src="/imgs/img_dqn_exp_replay_intuition.png"  alt="fig-dqn-exp-replay-intuition"   style="border-radius: 8px;"  />
    
      <figcaption class="center"  style="color: black;" >Figure 11. One type of correlation (sequential). Rewards and states visited depend on the previous experiences. Adapted from [8]</figcaption>
    
  </figure>



<p>We'll borrow the example from the Udacity Nanodegree [8] to explain this issue a bit further:
Suppose you are learning to play tennis, and you are using the action-value function
approximation algorithm from last section to learn from your tennis training experiences
whether to use your forehand or backhand shots in specific situations. Recall that unlike
the tabular case, nearby pairs in state-action space will have similar values (which is
actually what we wanted when discussing &quot;generalization&quot;). In the case of our tennis
example, if we learn online as we practice we might start getting a situation that
favors using our forehand shot (because we might have started getting changes to
do our forehand), which might be good for balls coming from the right. However,
due to our function approximator, our Q-function will start to favor ever so slightly
the forehand action even in cases were the ball comes to our left. I placed a question
mark for the q-values of the other action as we might not know how their values are evolving
as we update only the other action. If we have a single model for our \( Q_{\theta} \),
as we change the weights of our network we will also slightly alter the values for other
actions in potentially undesired ways.</p>

  </figure>



<p>To solve these issues, the Experience Replay mechanism makes the agent learn from
minibatches of past stored experience during training steps. We basically put all
our experience in memory and then sample uniformly at random from it, which helps
break the correlations between samples in the minibatch as they might not come
from consequent steps (or even come from different episodes). This is depicted in
Figure 13 below.</p>

  </figure>



<h3 id="353-dqn-fixed-targets">3.5.3 DQN: Fixed Targets</h3>

<p>During training we are using the TD-target as the estimate of the true q-values
that our Q-network should output for a specific pair \( (s,a) \) (as shown in
the equation below). Unfortunately, this estimate is being computed using the current
parameters of the Q-network which effectively is forcing us to follow a moving target.
Besides, this is not mathematically correct, as we assumed these &quot;true q-values&quot; were
not dependent on \( \theta \) (recall we did not take the gradient of this term).</p>

<p><span  class="math">\[
\theta := \theta + \alpha ( \overbrace{r + \max_{a'}Q(s',a';\theta)}^{\text{Computed with $\theta$}} - Q(s,a;\theta) ) \overbrace{\nabla_{\theta}Q_{\theta}\vert_{(s,a)}}^{\text{Computed with $\theta$}}
\]</span></p>

<p>To help training stability the authors of [2] introduced the use of a separate
network to compute these targets called a <strong>Target Network</strong>, which is almost the same as
the network used for taking actions. The key difference is that <strong>the weights of
this network are only copied from the weights of the other network after some specific
number of steps</strong>. Therefore, the update rule can be modified as follows :</p>

<p><span  class="math">\[
\theta := \theta + \alpha ( \overbrace{r + \max_{a'}\underbrace{Q(s',a';\theta^{-})}_{\text{Target-network}}}^{\text{Computed with $\theta^{-}$}} - Q(s,a;\theta) ) \overbrace{\nabla_{\theta}Q_{\theta}\vert_{(s,a)}}^{\text{Computed with $\theta$}}
\]</span></p>

<p>A slight variation to this update at constant intervals is to do updates every time
step using interpolations, as shown in the following equation :</p>

<p><span  class="math">\[
\theta^{-} := (1 - \tau) \theta^{-} + \tau \theta
\]</span></p>

<p>This are called soft-updates, and by adjusting the factor \( \tau \) (to some small
values) we get a similar effect of copying the weights of the networks after a fixed
number of steps. The difference is that, as the name suggests, these updates are less
jumpy than the hard-updates made by copying entirely the weights of the network. At convergence,
this update is very similar to a hard-update as the network weights do not change too much.</p>


  <figure class="center" >

      <figcaption class="center"  style="color: black;" >Figure 14. Soft updates v.s. Hard-updates to the weights of a target network</figcaption>
    
  </figure>



<h3 id="354-sidenote-on-the-intuition-behind-issues-with-correlations">3.5.4 Sidenote: on the intuition behind issues with correlations</h3>

<p>A way I like to use to reason about these issues related to correlations
is by looking at the loss function we want to optimize (shown below). As you can see,
we are computing a Mean-Square loss which computes the expectation over samples of
the square differences between targets and current estimates.</p>

<p><span  class="math">\[
L({\theta}) = \mathbb{E}_{(s,a,r,s') \sim D} \left \{ ( r + \gamma \max_{a'} Q_{\theta}(s',a') - Q_{\theta}(s,a) )^{2} \right \}
\]</span></p>

<p>As you can see, if our inputs (experience tuples) are correlated (breaking the
i.i.d. assumption) we will not be able to compute this expectation from samples
(can't apply the law of large numbers nor use a monte carlo estimate). Moreover,
if trying to convert our RL problem into a supervised setting we will run into
the issue that the target estimates (labels) should be decoupled from the estimates
of our model. If not, we can run in instabilities by following a moving target,
kind of like following our own opinions as universal truth, even when they might
not be correct. Even more, if we start having strong opinions about a topic and use
this to infer even more knowledge that reinforces these opinions, we will then fall
into a vicious cycle of unstable learning. If that is the case in life, keep an open
mind, recall good and bad experiences and don't forget to live with a little bit of
\( \epsilon \) here and there 😉.</p>

<h3 id="354-dqn-putting-it-all-together">3.5.4 DQN: Putting it all together</h3>

<p>Finally, by integrating all the previous improvements (Experience replay and Fixed
targets) we get the complete version of the DQN algorithm from [2]. Below we show

regular updates.</p>

<p>Below are some key aspects to take into consideration:</p>

<h3 id="preprocessing--phit--phi-st--"><strong>Preprocessing</strong> \( \phi_{t} = \phi( s_{t} ) \):</h3>

<p>This step consist in converting the states|observations \( s_{t} \) received
  from the simulator into an appropriate state representation that can be used
  by our action-value network \( Q(\phi_{t},a_{t};\theta) \). We usually receive
  observations from the environment which in some cases (if we are lucky) consist
  of the actual internal state representation of the world. Unfortunately, in
  most cases we only receive observations that do not permit to fully recover the
  internal state of the environment. To avoid this issue we can design a state
  representation from these observations that would push us a bit more into the MDP
  setting and not the POMDP setting (Partially Observable MDP). In [2] the authors
  designed a state representation from the raw frame observations from the simulator
  by stacking a group of 4 consecutive frames, which tries to help encode a bit of
  temporal information (like speed and movement in the scene). This step is problem
  specific, and in our Banana collector case we chose to use the direct observations
  as state representation, although we could have made modifications to add more temporal
  information which could help with the problem of <em>state aliasing</em>. For further information
  on this topic you can watch part of <a href="https://youtu.be/yPMkX_6-ESE?t=230">this</a> lecture from [7].</p>

<h3 id="grounding-terminal-estimates-"><strong>Grounding terminal estimates</strong> :</h3>

<p>Grounding the estimates for terminal states is important because we don't want
  to grant an estimate to the value for a terminal state bigger than what it could
  actually be. If we are just one step away of a terminal state, the  our trajectories
  have length one and the return we obtain is actually only that reward. All previous
  algorithms do a check of whether or not a state is terminal in order to compute
  the appropriate TD-target. However, in tabular Q-learning you will find that in some
  implementations (unlike the one we presented earliear) there is no check similar to
  this one, but instead the entries of the Q-table are set to zeros for the terminal states,
  which is effectively the same as doing this check, as shown in the equation below:</p>

<p><span  class="math">\[
  TD_{target} = r + \gamma \max_{a'}Q(s_{terminal}^{'},a') = r + \gamma max_{a'}0_{\vert \mathbb{A} \vert} = r
  \]</span></p>

<p>Unfortunaly, because we are dealing with function approximation, the estimates
  for a terminal states if evaluated will not return always zero, even if we initialize
  the function approximator to output zeros everywhere (like initializing the weights
  of a neural network to all zeros). This is caused by the fact that changes in the
  approximator parameters will affect the values of nearby states-action pairs in
  state-action space as well even in the slightest. For further information, you could
  check <a href="https://youtu.be/fevMOp5TDQs?t=137">this</a> lecture by Volodymyr Mnih from [9].
  So, keep this in mind when implementing your own version of DQN, as you might run
  into subtle bugs in your implementations.</p>

<h3 id="exploration-schedule-"><strong>Exploration schedule</strong> :</h3>

<p>Another important detail to keep in mind is the amount of exploration allowed
  by our \( \epsilon \)-greedy mechanism, and how we reduce it as learning progresses.
  This aspect is not only important in this context of function approximation, but in
  general as it's a key tradeoff to take into account (exploration v.s. exploitation dilemma).
  They idea is to give the agent a big enough number of steps to explore and get experiences
  that actually land some diverse good and bad returns, and then start reducing this
  ammount of exploration as learning progresses towards convergence. The mechanism
  used in [2] is to <em>linearly</em> decay \( \epsilon = 1.0 \rightarrow 0.1 \). Another
  method would be to decay it <em>exponentially</em> by multiplying \( \epsilon \) with a
  constant decay factor every episode. For further information you could check
  <a href="https://youtu.be/0g4j2k_Ggc4?t=805">this</a> lecture by David Silver from [6].</p>

<h3 id="choice-for--qthetasa-"><strong>Choice for \( Q_{\theta}(s,a) \)</strong></h3>

<p>The last detail is related to the actual choice we make how to model our Q-network.
  We have two choices: either treat both inputs \( s,a \) as a single input \( (s,a) \)
  to the network, which would allows us to compute one q-value for a given state-action
  pair, or use \( s \) as only input to the network and grab  all the q-values for
  all actions \( a \in \mathbb{A} \). Both of these options are shown in the figure below.</p>


  <figure class="center" >
    <img src="/imgs/img_dqn_qnetwork_choices.png"  alt="fig-dqn-qnetwork-choices"   style="border-radius: 8px;"  />
    
      <figcaption class="center"  style="color: black;" >Figure 15. Q-network choices. Left: A Q-network that outputs one value per state-action pair. Right: A Q-network that outputs all q-values over all actions for a given state</figcaption>
    
  </figure>



<p>The first option would cost more as we need to compute all q-values in order
  to grab the maximum of them for both the TD-target calculation and the \( \epsilon \)-greedy
  action selection. The second option was the one used in [2], and it's the one
  will use for our implementation.</p>

<p><strong>Sidenote</strong> : I couldn't help but notice that the cost function would change a bit
  due to our choice. Recall the loss function we defined for action-value function
  approximation:</p>

<p><span  class="math">\[
  L(\theta) = \mathbb{E}_{s,a} \left \{ ( Q^{\star}(s,a) - \hat Q_{\theta}(s,a) )^{2} \right \}
  \]</span></p>

<p>If using our choice of network we would have to change the term <span  class="math">\(\hat Q_{\theta}(s,a)\)</span>
  by the term <span  class="math">\(\hat Q_{\theta}^{(a)}(s)\)</span> (or equivalently <span  class="math">\(e_{a}^{T} \hat Q_{\theta}(s)\)</span> if you
  prefer dot products). Thus, our loss function would change to:</p>

<p><span  class="math">\[
  L(\theta) = \mathbb{E}_{s,a} \left \{ ( Q^{\star}(s,a) - \hat Q_{\theta}^{(a)}(s) )^{2} \right \}
  \]</span></p>

<p>Now, if we compute the gradient of this objective w.r.t. \( \theta \), after
  some operations (like in the function approximation derivation from earlier) we
  would get the following:</p>

<p><span  class="math">\[
  \nabla_{\theta}L = \mathbb{E}_{s,a} \left \{ 2 ( Q^{\star}(s,a) - \hat Q_{\theta}^{(a)}(s) ) \nabla_{\theta} \hat Q_{\theta}^{(a)}(s) \right \}
  \]</span></p>

<p>Or, if using the dot product instead of indexing:</p>

<p><span  class="math">\[
  \nabla_{\theta}L = \mathbb{E}_{s,a} \left \{ 2 ( Q^{\star}(s,a) - e_{a}^{T}\hat Q_{\theta}(s) ) \nabla_{\theta} (e_{a}^{T}\hat Q_{\theta}(s)) \right \}
  \]</span></p>

<p>If you expand the later (the gradient of the dot product) you can actually take that
  constant vector out, and then we would end up with the Jacobian of \( \hat Q_{\theta}(s) \).
  Both are at the end equivalent if you do the algebra, but I wonder how these are implemented
  by the autodiff. The funny thing is that this was a kind of hidden detail from most
  resources I found online. So, at first it looks like a linear regression problem (and
  that's how it should be if we had used the first option for the network instead), but
  instead it's like a multi-dimensional regression problem but with masks over some dimensions.
  Hopefully, autodiff handles this subtleties for us 😄. I'll update this part
  once I have some more time to get into the inner workings of the autodiff (so far,
  I was checking the torch's <a href="https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/master/tools/autograd/derivatives.yaml">derivatives.yaml</a>
  file where the gradient definitions are and it seems that the one doing the job
  might be the <em>index_select_backward</em> function when used by the <em>kthvalue</em> function,
  or the function <em>index_select</em>, or the function <em>gather</em>).</p>

<h2 id="4-dqn-implementation">4. DQN Implementation</h2>

<p>At last, in this section we will cover the full implementation of the DQN algorithm
from [2] that uses soft-updates. This implementation is based on the DQN implementation
from Deepmind (written in Torch and Lua), which can be found <a href="https://sites.google.com/a/deepmind.com/dqn/">here</a>.
Our implementation tried to decouple the key aspects of the algorithm from the model
itself in a kind of library-agnostic way (effectively decoupling the RL part from
the DL part). At the end of this section we will add some considerations we made
for our implementation.</p>

<p><strong>Disclaimer</strong>: the trained model has not been tested in the Bnana-Visual environment,
which provides as observations frames instead of the vector observations discussed
earlier. There might be some code that related to the visual case which I'd been
tested, but I'm still debugging it. I'll update this post with the visual case as well
once I have it working properly.</p>

<h3 id="41-interfaces-and-concretions">4.1 Interfaces and Concretions</h3>

<p>Our implementation makes use of abstractions and decoupling, as we implemented
the algorithm from scratch. The main reason is that we wanted to grasp extra
details of the algorithm without following another implementation step by step
(and also to avoid having a pile of tf.ops to deal with or some pytorch specific
functionality being around the core features of the algorithm 😄).</p>

<p>Just to be in the same page, by an <strong>Interface</strong> we mean a class that provides
a blueprint for other classes to extend. This interfaces could have declarations
of methods and data that its objects might have, but it does not implement them
(at least most of them) and leaves some <em>pure-virtual</em> methods to be implemented
by a child class. A concretion is a specific class that extends the functionality
of this interface, and it has to implement the pure-virtual methods. For example,
our <strong>agent interface</strong> defines the functionality that is exposed by any <em>agent</em>
along with some code that all concretions should have (like the actual steps of
the DQN algorithm) but leaves some methods for the concrete agents, like the preprocess
method which is case specific; and an <strong>agent concretion</strong> could be an agent that
extends this functionality (and gains the common DQN implementation) but implements
its own version of the preprocess step.</p>

<p>The interfaces and some of its concretions are shown below:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Agent Interface</strong>, along concrete agents for <strong>BananaSimple</strong>, <strong>BananaVisual</strong> and <strong>Gridworld</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Model Interface</strong>, along concrete models for <strong>Pytorch</strong>, <strong>Tensorflow</strong> or a <strong>numpy q-table</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Memory Interface</strong>, along concrete buffers like <strong>ReplayBuffer</strong> and <strong>PriorityBuffer</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p>We wanted to make these interfaces as decoupled as possible from any Deep Learning
package, which allowed us to test each component separately (we did not want to
get into subtle bugs and poor performance due to specifics of the DL package). We
specially made use of this feature when testing the core agent interface with a simple
gridworld environment. This allowed us to find some bugs in our inplementation of the
steps in the DQN algorithm that might have taken us more time if considering also
the possibility that our DL model was buggy.</p>

<h3 id="42-agent-interface-and-concretions">4.2 Agent Interface and Concretions</h3>

<p>This interface has the implementation of the steps in the DQN algorithm, and has
as components the model and memory in order to query them as needed. This is an
&quot;Abstract Class&quot; in the sense that it shouldn't be instantiated. Instead, a specific
class that inherits from this interface has to implement the <strong>preprocess</strong> method.
Below we show this interface (only the methods, to give a sense of how this interface works),
which can be found in the <a href="https://github.com/wpumacay/DeeprlND-projects/blob/master/project1-navigation/navigation/dqn/core/agent.py">agent.py</a>
file in the <strong>dqn/core</strong> folder of the navigation package.</p>

<p>The key methods to be considered are the <strong><strong>init</strong></strong>, <strong>act</strong>, <strong>step</strong>, <strong>_preprocess</strong>
and <strong>_learn</strong> methods, which implement most of the required steps of the DQN algorithm.
We will discuss some of the details of these in snippets below, and encourage to
look at the full implementation using the hyperlinks provided. Some might have
some details removed (like dev. changes during testing), so they might look a bit
different than the originals from the repo.</p>

file contains a concrete implementation of the model interface using Tensorflow
as Deep Learning library. Below there is a snippet with most of the contents of
this file. The <strong>DqnModelTensorflow</strong> class serves a container for the Tensorflow
Ops created for the computation graph that implements the required evaluation and
training steps. For the architecture, instead of creating tf ops for each layer,
we decided to just use keras to create the required ops of the q-networks internally
(see the <em>createNetworkCustom</em> function), and then build on top of them by creating
other ops required for training and evaluation (see the <em>build</em> method). Because we
are creating a static graph beforehand makes it easier to see where we are going to
have gradients being computed and used. If our model has its <strong>_trainable</strong> flag
set to false we then just create the required ops for evaluation only (used for
computing the TD-targets), whereas if our model is trainable, then we create
the full computation graph which goes from inputs (minibatch <span  class="math">\(\left \{ (s,a) \right \}\)</span>)
to the MSE loss using the estimates from the network and the TD-targets passed for training.</li>

which is in charge of all functionality used for training and evaluation, like:</p>

<ul>
<li>Creating the environment to be studied.</li>
<li>Implementing the RL loops for either training or testing.</li>
<li>Loading and saving configuration files for different tests.</li>
<li>Saving statistics from training for later analysis.</li>

<p>This trainer came in handy when running various training sessions with different
configurations for some ablation tests (we did not mention it, but the agent
receives configuration objects that can be loaded and saved using <a href="https://github.com/wpumacay/DeeprlND-projects/tree/master/project1-navigation/configs">.json</a>
files).</p>

<p>Finally, note that we developed a <a href="https://github.com/wpumacay/DeeprlND-projects/blob/master/project1-navigation/navigation/envs/mlagents.py">small wrapper</a>
on top of our ml-agents environment itself, in order to make it follow a more standard
(and gym-like) way. Unity ml-agents has also an API for this, but as we are using
an older version of the library we might had run into some issues, so we decided
just to go with a simple env. wrapper and call it a day. Note that we also wanted
to go for a standard gym-like API in order to reuse a simple <a href="https://github.com/wpumacay/DeeprlND-projects/blob/master/project1-navigation/navigation/envs/gridworld.py">Gridworld</a>
env. for testing purposes.</p>

<h3 id="46-considerations-and-tradeoffs">4.6 Considerations and tradeoffs</h3>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Why not directly couple everything?, isn't it faster?</strong>: Well, sections that could
benefit from coupling would be sections that make heavy use of cpu-gpu transfers (kind of like
passing constantly tensors between cpu and gpu, so it could be faster to just leave them in gpu).
The only section so far that could benefit would be the TD-targets calculations, which
does evaluation in data from minibatches from memory in the current device (either cpu
or gpu) and then copies this data back to numpy ndarrays. We could actually write
more ops (in tensorflow) for the whole TD-target calculation and training all in
one pass, or avoid making copies from gpu to cpu from pytorch tensors, but the only
part that would benefit would be the TD-targets transfer, which is a batch of vectors.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Why not place everything in a notebook?</strong>: Short answer: it's not my usual workflow.
Long answer: I'd argue that doing it without notebooks can help you debug things easily,
specially when you don't have all modules already completed. I've used jupyter notebooks
for experiments and they're great for showing results (in fact, some of the results are
accesible through some notebooks in the repo), but for the full code I don't think they
are the best option. Besides, I'd argue that debugging issues using <strong>pdb</strong> (or in
more detail using <strong>code</strong>) is way easier and better than using a notebook (these tools
really saved my day quite sometimes). I'd suggest you give it a try as well by running
your scripts in <em>debug</em> mode, as shown below.</p></li>

<p>Initially, our implementation was supposed to be working on gym environments that
had a continuous state space and a discrete action space, being the environment
suggested for testing gym's LunarLander. We had various bugs before we could have
a working implementation of the DQN on this gym environment:</p>

<h3 id="crashes-everywhere-">Crashes everywhere :</h3>

<p>This where the more simple to fix. They where mostly due
  to our inexperience with the Deep learning package at hand. We decided to first
  implement the concrete model in PyTorch as we were already provided with a solution
  that we could refer to in the worst case scenario. For this part, using <strong>pdb</strong>
  and running the scripts in debug mode helped a lot to debug shapes, arguments that
  some functions expected in some specific way (squeeze and unsqueeze here and there).
  PyTorch was a charm to work with because if something crashed we could just evaluate
  some tensors using pdb (or worst case using <strong>code</strong>). I'd suggest checking <a href="https://www.codementor.io/stevek/advanced-python-debugging-with-pdb-g56gvmpfa">this</a>
  post, which explains how to use pdb really well.</p>

<h3 id="simple-test-cases-">Simple test cases :</h3>

<p>Once everything was not crashing, and after various passes
  to the code to check that everything should work fine, we decided to let the beast
  loose and destroy the task. Well, that didn't go that well, as I only ended up
  destroying a virtual lunar lander every episode. There were some bugs in the code
  that I just didn't noticed, even after various passes to the code. This is were
  having a decouple and modularized implementation comes in handy.</p>

<p>You see, it's a bit frustrating when you look at your code and everything seems
  fine but it just doesn't, and you actually have lots of places you can check and
  knobs you can tune. Where the errors due to my hyperparameters?. Was there an error
  that might have slipped all my checks?. Hopefully, I had watched a <a href="https://youtu.be/8EcdaCk9KaQ">lecture</a>
  from the DeepRL bootcamp in which John Schulman discussed the nuts and bolts of DeepRL.
  A suggestion saved me was to test in a simple toy problem and then start scaling up to your
  problem at hand. So, I happened to have a gridworld environment laying around that I knew
  that tabular q-learning should work.</p>
